Fitness App

A full stack web application that uses Django for the backend, React for the front end, and PostgreSQL as the database.
This application allows the user to input information about a workout they did, and add it to their workout lists.
Information such as the name of the workout, date, cardio completed, calories burned, the weight, sets, and repetitions of
an exercise can all be saved. 
Users are also able to add exercise ideas to a recommendations list to remind them of an exercise they might want to
do again or try out.
